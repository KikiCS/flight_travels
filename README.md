# flight_compare

## Introduction

Flights search engines only list their results based on one filter (e.g., cost of the flight), but when I decide which flight to book, more than one aspect comes into play: that's why I am trying to plot different solutions in 2 dimensions with this dynamic page.

## Tools

This is a project to enhance my HTML/CSS/Javascript skills, focusing especially on D3.js

## Wishlist:

- [x] Dynamic updating when adding new options
- [ ] Flight/airport name label next to each point
- [ ] API to retrieve public transport from home to airport
- [ ] API to retrieve flights (?)
- [ ] Geolocation to evaluate automatically starting point
- [ ] (Optional) Possibility to eliminate flights from the chart (click?)
- [ ] (Nice-to-have) Flight info when hovering on or next to a point
- [ ] Beautiful graphics/colours/ proper CSS
